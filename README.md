#Softmax Regression, One-vs-All and One-vs-One for Multi-class Classification

how to convert a linear classifier into a multi-class classifier, including multinomial logistic regression or softmax regression, One vs. All (One-vs-Rest) and One vs. One.


In Multi-class classification, we classify data into multiple class labels. Unlike classification trees and k-nearest neighbor, the concept of multi-class classification for linear classifiers is not as straightforward. We can convert logistic regression to multi-class classification using multinomial logistic regression or softmax regression; this is a generalization of logistic regression, this will not work for support vector machines. One vs. All (One-vs-Rest) and One vs. One are two other multi-class classification techniques can convert any two-class classifier into a multi-class classifier.
